31/08/18 -  As well as the todos in the code (which are for smaller issues) I need to change the jump pattern, as it's a bit too long at the moment, and update the editor so as collision detection rectangles can be drawn over the image to suit its shape as opposed to the collision detection being based on the rectangle that is the image borders.
