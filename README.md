TODOS -   

1: todos in the code (for smaller issues) 

2: Need to make the speeds and distances that the sprites move and jump scale based on the screen size in the same way that the heights and widths do

3: Need to get rid of mongodb and have a file-based db instead so as it can all be easily distributed without users having to install mongodb and also having to somehow get hold of the data for the levels.  The data could be easily included in the distributable if the storage was file-based.

4: Include a set of instructions for distribution
