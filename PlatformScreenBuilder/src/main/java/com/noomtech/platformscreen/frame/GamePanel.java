/**
 * Currently this is where it all happens.  This panel class is responsible for the painting, control handling and collision detection in the game.
 *
 * The game itself is a simple Manic Miner/Jet Set Willy type thing i.e. with controls of "left", "right" and "jump" in a screen full of
 * platforms.
 *
 * There is quite a lot of code around obtaining a high level of precision on the controls, as this is important in a platform game.
 *
 * Platforms or "collision areas" are represented on screen as {@link Rectangle}s and the main sprite is too, with the idea
 * that these will be replaced with something nicer looking where only their boundaries are defined by rectangles.
