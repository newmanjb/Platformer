/**
 * This panel class is responsible for the painting of the game and also acts as a hub for events.
 * NOTE ON MOVEMENT - The movement of the player is handled by the {@link JSWControlsHandler}, which obviously has to
 * respond to key events.  The movement of anything else is computer-controlled and is handled by the {@link ComputerControlledMovementHandler}.
 * Each {@link GameObject}, which represents any object in the game, uses interfaces or abstract classes in
 * order to indicate whether it moves, is static, or is static but animated etc..
